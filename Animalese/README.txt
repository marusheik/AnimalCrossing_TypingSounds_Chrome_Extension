These are the files used by the villagers when talking to the player. They are actually personality based however, which is pretty interesting. As different personalities have quite different tones.

i have fixed / revised the file names to their respective BWAV files. no more confusion what are the files sound like (now with BWAV and WAV files in each of the personality files)

now with "Ghost" from "Doubutsugo_Ghost.bars". which i suspect this is wisp's animalese, though...



with that in mind, here's the breakdown of how animalese in new horizons spoken: (coming from someone who hasn't play the game just yet, this breakdown may be inaccurate, but i'll try my best to, postulate about this)

-speeds up to approx. 100% of the base talking speed for each line of sentence
(this is based on my experiment using Audacity software though, but i'm not sure for any other software as well)

-may comprised of 1 semitone lower and higher for each Kana, and KanaEx within a sentence, and sometimes 2 semitones lower and higher (-2 , -1 , 0 , 1 , 2), but for some reason some vilagers may speak up to 4 semitones higher (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
(assume all the animalese files are at 0 as base pitch. i highly believe that all villagers' animalese talking is "set" to 0 as a thorough base pitch. special characters (e.g. tom nook, isabelle, timmy & tommy, flick, cj, and so on) on the other hand have different modifier for each of their thorough base pitch)
(for example, timmy & tommy's animalese is lazy, and their pitch sounds higher than usual, somewhere around 2 semitone higher. and therefore the pitch will be 0, then 1, 2, 3 and 4 semitone higher) (0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 | with 2 as a base pitch) (P.S.: THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE. I'M NOT TOO SURE FOR THE ACTUAL MODIFIER HOWEVER)

-comprised of mora, as some suggests so (regardless of the languages supported, it seems that different language have different ways of how animalese is spoken. i'm not too sure how for some reason, sorry :( )
