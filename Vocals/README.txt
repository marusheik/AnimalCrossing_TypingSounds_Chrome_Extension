These are the files used for the villagers singing a song. They are differed into 3 categories: Boy, Girl, and Man.

Boy: As the name implies, Male villagers use these audio files for singing (Cranky villagers are the exception).

Girl: Female villagers use these audio files for singing.

Man: Only Cranky villagers use these audio files for singing, i believe.

("BONUS") Whistle: Just a bunch of whistle sounds used by villagers when singing sometimes, nothing more.

Notice the audio files there. They quite "resembling" the vocals sang by K.K. Slider (where K.K. Slider sings in "Nah", "Me", "Way", "Oh", "Now", "low 'Oh' ", "low 'Me' "). Only difference is, just the way the villagers sing.
